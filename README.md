## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project introduced me to working with CSS Grid. In particular, this project helped me to learn to work with grid and flexbox together.

### Continued development

In future projects I'd like to use grid to create more complex layouts. For this project I only created a one and two column layout (depending on the user's screen width).
